            <h2>Scales</h2>
            <div class="scales_lessons">
              <p> A scale is a sequence of musical notes arranged in a specific order.
                 On the piano, there are 12 different notes (or "pitches") in each octave, starting from A and ending at G#. 
                 These notes are arranged in a repeating pattern of white and black keys, with the white keys representing the "natural" notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and the black keys
                  representing the "sharps" and "flats" (A#/Bb, C#/Db, D#/Eb, F#/Gb, G#/Ab).<br><br>

                There are many different types of scales that you can play on the piano, but some of the most common include:<br><br>
                
                Major scale: This is the most basic and commonly used scale in Western music. 
                It consists of 7 different notes, arranged in a specific pattern of whole steps (W) and half steps (H). 
                The pattern for a major scale is W-W-H-W-W-W-H. For example, the C major scale includes the notes
                 C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.<br><br>
                
                Natural minor scale: This scale is similar to the major scale, but with a different pattern of whole and half steps.
                 The pattern for a natural minor scale is W-H-W-W-H-W-W. For example, the A natural minor scale includes
                  the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.<br><br>
                
                Harmonic minor scale: This scale is similar to the natural minor scale, but with a raised seventh note.
                 The pattern for a harmonic minor scale is W-H-W-W-H-WH-H. For example, the A harmonic minor scale includes
                  the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G#.<br><br>
                
                Melodic minor scale: This scale is similar to the harmonic minor scale, but with a raised sixth and seventh note 
                when ascending (going up) and a lowered sixth and seventh note when descending (going down). 
                The pattern for a melodic minor scale is W-H-W-W-W-W-H. For example, the A melodic minor scale includes the notes A, B, C, D, E, F#, and G# when ascending,
                 and A, B, C, D, E♭, F, and G when descending.<br><br>
                
                Blues scale: This scale is commonly used in blues and rock music.
                 It consists of six notes and includes both major and minor thirds. 
                 The pattern for a blues scale is 1-b3-4-b5-5-b7. For example, the C blues scale includes
                  the notes C, E♭, F, G♭, G, and B♭.<br><br>
                
                  Pentatonic scale: This scale is made up of five notes and is commonly used in many different styles of music,
                   including rock, pop, and folk. There are two main types of pentatonic scales: major and minor. The pattern for a major pentatonic scale is W-W-3H-W-3H, 
                   and the pattern for a minor pentatonic scale is W-3H-W-W-3H. For example, the C major pentatonic scale includes the notes C, D, E, G, and A, and the C minor pentatonic scale
                    includes the notes C, E♭, F, G, and B♭.<br><br>

                  Chromatic scale: This scale includes all twelve notes in the Western music system and is used primarily for chromaticism,
                   or the use of notes outside of a particular key or scale. The pattern for a chromatic scale is simply a series of half steps,
                    starting from any note on the piano.<br><br>
                  
                  Whole-tone scale: This scale is made up entirely of whole steps and is used primarily for its unique sound and lack of a clear tonal center.
                   The pattern for a whole-tone scale is W-W-W-W-W-W. For example, the C whole-tone scale includes
                    the notes C, D, E, F#, G#, and A#.<br><br>
                  
                  Modes: Modes are scales that are derived from the major and minor scales by starting on a different note within the scale.
                   For example, the second mode of the major scale is called the Dorian mode and has a unique pattern of whole and half steps (W-H-W-W-W-H-W). 
                   Similarly, the sixth mode of the major scale is called the Aeolian mode (also known as the natural minor scale) and has a different pattern of whole and half steps (W-H-W-W-H-W-W).
                    Each mode has its own unique sound and can be used to create different moods and tonalities in music.<br><br>
                  
                  Exotic scales: There are many other types of scales that are used in different cultures and musical traditions around the world, 
                  including the pentatonic blues scale, the Hungarian minor scale, and the Phrygian dominant scale. Learning about these scales and incorporating them into your playing can be a great way
