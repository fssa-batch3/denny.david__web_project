            <h2>What is music?</h2>
            <p> Music is a collection of coordinated sound or sounds. Making music is the process of putting sounds and
                tones in an order, often combining them
                to create a unified composition. </p>

            <h2>What is keyboard?</h2>
            <p>A musical keyboard is the set of adjacent depressible levers or keys on a musical instrument.
                Keyboards typically contain keys for playing the twelve notes of the Western musical scale, with a
                combination of larger, longer keys and smaller, shorter keys that repeats at the interval of an octave.
                Pressing a key on the keyboard makes the instrument produce soundsâ€”either by mechanically striking a
                string or tine , plucking a string , causing air to flow through a pipe organ, striking a bell , or, on
                electric and electronic keyboards, completing a circuit (Hammond organ, digital piano, synthesizer).
                Since the most commonly encountered keyboard instrument is the piano, the keyboard layout is often
                referred to as the piano keyboard.

            <h2>What are the keys name?</h2>
            <p>The white keys are known as natural notes,
                and the black keys are known as the sharps and flats</p><br>

            <h2>What is octave?</h2>
            <p>An octave represents the interval from one musical pitch or note to another.
                It is the distance from one note to the next note of the same name.
                It takes eight white keys to get to the next latter-named note, hence why we call it an octave.
                There are 12 keys in an octave.
                And then there are 7 white keys and 5 black keys in an octave.There are 5 octaves in any keyboard.
                But in piano there are 8 octave .Here all the octaves are more or less same.
                But the sound will change in every octave which means high notes and the low notes. </p>
