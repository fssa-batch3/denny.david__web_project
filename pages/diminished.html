    <h2>Diminshed chords</h2>
    <div class="diminshed_lessons">
        A diminished chord is a chord consisting of a root note, 
        a minor third, and a diminished fifth. It's often denoted with a small circle (°) 
        or the abbreviation "dim." For example, a C diminished chord would 
        be notated as C° or Cdim.<br><br>

       To construct a diminished chord, you take the root note, and then count up three half-steps 
       (or one-and-a-half whole steps) to find the minor third. Then, you count up another three 
       half-steps (or one-and-a-half whole steps) from the minor third 
       to find the diminished fifth.<br><br>

        Here are a few examples of diminished chords:<br>

       C° (C, E♭, G♭)<br>
       D° (D, F, A♭)<br>
       F#° (F#, A, C)<br>
       Diminished chords are often used in chord progressions as a passing chord, or as a substitute for dominant 7th chords.
        They can also be used to create tension
         and dissonance in music.<br><br>

       Diminished chords have a symmetrical structure. A diminished chord is made up of two stacked minor thirds. 
       This means that you can invert the chord every minor third and still get the same notes. For example, a C°
        chord can also be thought of as E♭° or G♭°.<br><br>

       Diminished chords have multiple uses in music.
        In addition to being used as a passing chord and a substitute for dominant 7th chords, 
        diminished chords can also be used to modulate to a new key, as a pivot chord, or to add
         color to a melody.<br><br>

       Diminished chords can be used to create tension and dissonance. 
       Since the notes in a diminished chord are all a minor third apart, they create a sense of instability and tension.
        This can be useful for adding drama and intensity
         to a piece of music.<br><br>

       Diminished chords are often found in minor keys. 
       In a minor key, the seventh chord is a diminished chord. For example, in the key of C minor,
        the seventh chord is B° (B, D, F). This is because the seventh scale degree is a half step below the tonic,
         and the diminished chord helps to create a sense of 
         tension and pull towards the tonic.<br><br>

      Diminished chords can be used to create chord progressions with chromatic movement. 
      By using diminished chords to connect chords that are a half step apart, you can create a progression with lots of chromatic movement. 
      For example, a progression like C - B° - B♭ - A° - A♭ - G - G♭ - F can create a sense of tension and release
       through the use of diminished chords.<br><br>
