    <!-- These are all suspended chords -->
 <div class="sus">
 <h2>Suspended chords</h2>
 <div class="sus1"> 
 <p>
    Suspended chords are formed by replacing the third of a chord with either the second (sus2) or the fourth (sus4) note of the scale.
     For example, a C major chord with the third replaced by the second would be written as Csus2 (C, D, G), while a C major chord with the third replaced by the fourth would be written as 
     Csus4 (C, F, G).<br><br>

    Suspended chords are often used as a way to add tension and release to a chord progression.
     Because they don't contain the "stable" third note of a chord, they create a sense of uncertainty that can be resolved by returning to
      a more "conventional" chord.<br><br>
    
    Suspended chords can also be used to create interesting harmonies in their own right.
     Depending on the context and the melody, a sus chord can sound melancholic, uplifting,
      or simply unusual.<br><br>
    
    Suspended chords can be used in a wide variety of genres,
     from folk and country to rock and pop. You can find examples of
      sus chords in classic songs like "Sweet Child O' Mine" (Guns N' Roses), 
      "Behind Blue Eyes" (The Who), and "With or 
      Without You" (U2).<br><br>
    
    It's important to note that suspended chords are not the same as extended chords.
     While extended chords add additional notes (like 7ths, 9ths, and 13ths) to a chord, 
     suspended chords simply replace one of the existing notes. This means that you can't play a "C7sus4" chord, for example â€“ 
     you would have to choose between a "C7" chord and a "Csus4" chord.<br><br>

     Suspended chords can be used in a variety of ways to create interesting chord progressions.
      For example, you can use a sus2 chord to transition between two major chords that are a whole step apart. 
      Or, you can use a sus4 chord to create tension before resolving 
      to a major or minor chord.<br><br>

    Suspended chords can also be used to create "open" voicings, where the notes of the chord are spread out over a wider range.
 This can be especially useful on guitar or piano, where it can be challenging to fit all the notes of a
  chord into a single octave.<br><br>

     In some cases, suspended chords can be used to substitute for major or minor chords in a progression.
 For example, a sus4 chord can be used instead of a major chord in a IV - V - I progression (such as in the song "Let it Be"
  by The Beatles).<br><br>

     When playing suspended chords, it's important to pay attention to the context of the chord progression and the melody.
 In some cases, a sus2 or sus4 chord may clash with the melody or other chords in the progression. In other cases, 
 it may fit perfectly and create a
  memorable moment in the song.<br><br>

     Finally, it's worth noting that there are other types of suspended chords beyond sus2 and sus4.
 For example, you can have a "sus6" chord, which replaces the third with the sixth note of the scale. 
 You can also have "add" chords, which add a note to a chord without replacing any of the existing notes.
  For example, a "Cadd9" chord would include the notes C, E, G, and 
  D (the ninth note of the C major scale).<br><br>
