    <div class="about_timing">
        <p>
            Timing in music refers to the rhythm or the duration of the notes played or sung in a particular piece of 
            music. In piano, timing is crucial to create a cohesive and harmonious sound.
             Some important concepts related to timing in piano music include:
        </p><br></div>
    <div class ="timing_signatures">
       <p> 1.Tempo: This refers to the speed of the music. It is indicated by a specific term or a metronome marking, which represents the number of beats per minute (BPM). A slow tempo will have a lower BPM, while a faster tempo will have a higher BPM.</p>
<br>
        <p>2.Beat: This is the basic unit of rhythm in music. It is a regular, recurring pulse that divides the music into equal parts. In piano music, each beat is usually indicated by a vertical line called a barline.</p><br>
        
        <p>3.Time Signature: This is a symbol at the beginning of a piece of music that indicates the number of beats in each bar and the type of note that represents one beat. For example, a time signature of 4/4 means that there are four beats in each bar
             and a quarter note represents one beat.</p><br>
        
        <p>4.Syncopation: This refers to an emphasis on a weak beat or a subdivision of a beat, creating a rhythmic 
            contrast with the underlying pulse. It can add interest and complexity to the music.</p><br>
        
        <p>5.Rubato: This is a technique where the performer plays with the timing of the music, slowing down or 
            speeding up certain parts to create a more expressive or emotional performance.</p><br>
    
        <p>
            2/4 time: This time signature consists of two quarter notes per bar and is often used in marches and other upbeat music.<br>
            3/4 time: This time signature consists of three quarter notes per bar and is often used in waltzes and other dance music.<br>
            4/4 time: This time signature consists of four quarter notes per bar and is the most common time signature in popular music, rock, and many other genres.<br>
            6/8 time: This time signature consists of six eighth notes per bar and is often used in Celtic and Latin American music.<br>
            9/8 time: This time signature consists of nine eighth notes per bar and is often used in Irish and other folk music.<br>
            12/8 time: This time signature consists of twelve eighth notes per bar and is often used in blues and jazz music.<br>
