    <h2>What is chord?</h2>
    <div class="chord_intro">
       <p>A chord in piano is a group of two or more notes that are played simultaneously. Chords are an essential component of music, 
        as they can create a harmonious sound that supports a melody or a solo.<br><br>

        Here are some lessons to help you understand and play chords on the piano:</p><br>
    </div>
       <div class="chord_lessons">
        <p>1.Start with the basics: The first step is to understand the structure of chords. A chord is made up of three or more notes that are played together. The most basic chord is the triad, which is made up of three notes: the root, the third, and the fifth. For example, a C major chord is made up of the notes C, E, and G.</p><br>



<p>2.Practice playing chords: Start by practicing basic triads in different keys. Play each chord separately and make sure that each note is clear and distinct. Once you feel comfortable playing individual chords, practice moving smoothly from one chord to another. This will help you develop the muscle memory and finger dexterity you need to play chords smoothly.</p><br>

<p>3.Learn different types of chords: Once you have mastered basic triads, you can move on to more complex chords, such as seventh chords, ninth chords, and suspended chords. These chords add more color and complexity to your playing, and can help you create more interesting harmonies.</p><br>

<p>4.Use chords in your playing: Once you feel comfortable playing chords, try incorporating them into your playing. Experiment with different chord progressions and rhythms to create your own unique sound.</p><br>
