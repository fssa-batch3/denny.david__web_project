    <h2>Augmented chords</h2>
    <div class="aug_lessons">
        Definition: An augmented chord is a chord made up of a root note, a major third, 
        and an augmented fifth. The augmented fifth is a raised fifth, meaning it is one half-step higher than the perfect fifth found in major and minor chords. For example, the C augmented chord includes
         the notes C, E, and G#.<br><br>

        Function: Augmented chords are often used as transitional or passing chords, meaning they are used to create tension and move 
        between other chords. They can also be used to create a sense of ambiguity or dissonance
         in a musical piece.<br><br>
        
        Notation: Augmented chords are typically notated with a "+" symbol after the chord letter.
         For example, a C augmented chord may be notated
          as C+ or Caug.<br><br>
        
        Inversions: Like other chords, augmented chords can be played in different inversions, 
        meaning the notes are played in a different order. To invert an augmented chord, simply move the lowest note up an octave.
         For example, the first inversion of a C augmented chord would be E, G#, C.<br><br>
        
        Practice exercises: To improve your proficiency with augmented chords, you can practice playing them in different keys
         and inversions. You can also practice playing augmented chords in context, such as using them as passing chords in a chord progression. 
         Finally, you can experiment with using augmented chords in different musical styles and genres to develop your understanding 
         of their function and sound.<br><br>
