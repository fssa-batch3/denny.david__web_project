            <h2> Finding chords of a song </h2>
        <div class="finding_lessons">
           <p> Listen to the song and try to identify the chords by ear.
             This can be a bit tricky if you're new to music theory, but with practice, you'll get better at
              recognizing chords and chord progressions.<br><br>

            Look up the chords online.
             There are many websites that offer chord charts for popular songs.
              Some examples include Ultimate Guitar, Chordify, and Songsterr. 
              Keep in mind that not all chord charts are accurate, so it's a good idea to compare 
              multiple sources if possible.<br><br>
            
            Analyze the song's melody and harmony to determine the chords. This method requires a bit 
            more music theory knowledge, but it can be helpful if you're having trouble figuring out 
            the chords by ear or if you want to verify the accuracy of a chord chart. To do this, you'll
             need to understand things like chord progressions, key signatures, and chord inversions.<br><br>
            
            Use software to help you identify the chords.
             There are many apps and software programs that can help you identify the chords of a song.
              Some examples include Chord Detector, Capo, and Transcribe!. Keep in mind that these tools are not always 100% accurate, 
              so it's still a good idea to use your ears and your music theory knowledge to verify the results.<br><br>

              Listen to the song and try to identify the minor chords by ear. 
              Just like with major chords, it can be helpful to familiarize yourself with the sound of different types of minor chords
            (e.g. natural minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor).<br><br>

             Look up the chords online.
              As with major chords, there are many websites that offer chord charts for popular songs that include the minor chords. 
              Some examples include Ultimate 
              Guitar, Chordify, and Songsterr.<br><br>

            Analyze the song's melody and harmony to determine the minor chords. 
            This method also requires music theory knowledge, but it can be especially helpful for songs that use complex chord progressions 
            or non-diatonic chords. Pay attention to the key signature and the relationships between the chords to help 
            you identify the minor chords.<br><br>

             Use software to help you identify the minor chords.
              Many of the same apps and software programs that can identify major chords can also identify minor chords.
               Some examples include Chord Detector,
                Capo, and Transcribe!.<br><br>
