    <h2>Seventh chords</h2>
    <div class="seventh_intro">
      <p>
        A seventh chord is a type of chord that contains four notes: the root note, a third above the root, a fifth above the root, and a seventh above the root.
         The seventh chord can be constructed using different intervals between the notes, resulting in different types of seventh chords. Here are the four main
          types of seventh chords:</p>

    <div class="few_lessons">
      <p>
    1. Dominant Seventh Chord: This chord is built by adding a minor seventh interval (10 semitones) above the root of a major triad. The formula for 
    a dominant seventh chord is (1, 3, 5, b7) or
     Root, Major Third, Perfect Fifth, and Minor
      Seventh. For example, the dominant seventh
       chord in the key of C would be C7 (C, E, G, Bb).</p>
<br>

      <p>2.Major Seventh Chord: This chord is built by adding a major seventh interval (11 semitones) above the root of a major triad. The formula for a major seventh chord is (1, 3, 5, 7) or Root, Major Third, Perfect Fifth, and Major Seventh. For example, the major seventh chord in the key of C would be
     CMaj7 (C, E, G, B).</p>
<br>

     <p>3.Minor Seventh Chord: This chord is built by adding a minor seventh interval (10 semitones) above the root of a minor triad. The formula for a minor seventh chord is (1, b3, 5, b7) or Root, Minor Third, Perfect Fifth, and Minor Seventh. For example, the minor seventh chord in the key of
     A would be Am7 (A, C, E, G).</p>
<br>

     <p> 4.Half-Diminished Seventh Chord: This chord is built by adding a minor seventh interval (10 semitones) and a diminished fifth interval (6 semitones) above the root of a minor triad. The formula for a half-diminished seventh chord is (1, b3, b5, b7) or Root, Minor Third, Diminished Fifth, 
     and Minor Seventh. For example, the half-diminished seventh chord in the key 
     of Bb would be Bbm7b5 (Bb, Db, Fb, Ab).</p>
